\section{Conclusions}
\qquad Mammo is designed to provide radiologists and medical field students/trainees with a way to have mammograms analyzed and categorized under four breast lesion categories namely benign mass, malignant mass, benign calcification, and malignant calcification. Moreover, the software provides the medical students/trainees an exam to evaluate their knowledge regarding breast cancer, mammograms, etc. \\
	
	The software utilized a Convolutional Neural Network, specifically ResNet-50, to analyze the mammograms' region of interest and to classify. Although initially the accuracy was poor, only achieving 33\% with the test set, the accuracy was improved significantly up to 43\% by balancing the dataset used in the development of the network. The data set used was from CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography).
