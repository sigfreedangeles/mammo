\section{Recommendations}
\qquad Reflecting upon the training process, the model could be improved by applying data augmentation techniques such as applying a series of scaling, translations, rotations, and flipping on each image of the dataset consequently increasing the instances per category by a significant margin. It is also noted that the dataset should be made balanced for even higher accuracy. \\

	Moreover, there should be an option for the users to retrain the model as they upload mammogram/s or to correct the model if it were to give out an erroneous reading as this would improve model accuracy and generalization well beyong initial training. \\

	As for the design aspect of the model and application, having the model be trained on whole image mammograms would eliminate the need for the user to set a cropped ROI which is a tedious task especially when the user has a batch of mammograms to be analyzed.
